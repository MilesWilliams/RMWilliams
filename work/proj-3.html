      <strong>Here comes the part </strong>of me selling myself and my skills; being in the hospitality industry, I’ve learnt a lot of social, managerial skills and techniques, however my passion always lay within web design and development. Thus I began the journey of moulding and acquiring the necessary tools one needs to successfully enter this industry.</p>
       <p>
        With this being my first of many websites, it enabled me to hone in on areas needing refinement, areas of strength and an overall improvement. Being self taught, and with YouTube as a sensei, I feel I have managed to get into a position that I can comfortably be able to enter the job market. I have a lot more to learn but then this is the reoccurring nature of the industry.
